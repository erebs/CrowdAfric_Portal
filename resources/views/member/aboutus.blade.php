				<p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdAfrik is a fintech company designed for the funding of various projects for African countries &nbsp;to enhance economic growth and poverty reduction. Our app allows users to select interests, apply for funding by paying our specified application processing fees applicable to the area/product being applied for. Applicants are also required to provide additional information necessary &nbsp;to ensure that any default in the funding repayments the applicant could be traced. Applicants are also required to provide 5 guarantors, who are known to the applicant and can stand almost as joint guarantors. Guarantors are usually contacted to confirm willingness to guarantee and the sum which they are guaranteeing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Funding is determined through a lottery system, held daily, weekly, or monthly based on the sector of funding. These are displayed at the site or notified to the applicants. &nbsp;Interests. Where a successful applicant is found to have supplied fake or misleading information, the application is instantly terminated &nbsp;without any refunds. Costs for starting businesses are paid directly to firms or third parties supplying what are required &nbsp;for the successful execution of the business. This is to prevent misuse of the allotted funds&gt; Also because we possibly order in large quantities to serve other applicants across Africa, our rates become less. &nbsp;However, in some cases such as farming, manual labour etc we may provide some cash for other operational needs such as paying labourers. &nbsp;. We closely monitor applicants progress and often assign applicants to our Business Mentor Coordinators who engage and support the applicants in areas of interest. Our funds are not free or charity funds, therefore we expect applicants to agree to a repayment plan that is most suitable for the business. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdAfrik is backed by investors who are mainly Africans in diaspora and our &ldquo;Specialist Investor Program (SIP). &nbsp;SIP investors are also Diasporean Africans who may wish to support their families and friends through the provision of any specific item which are in our lists and they are allocated to their agreed person without that applicant knowing it&apos;s coming from him/her. CrowdAfrik then treats it as our normal investment, recouping the capital with marginal interests and repaying the investor.</p>
